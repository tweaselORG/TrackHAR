According to [Branch's documentation](https://help.branch.io/partners-portal/docs/segment-export#3-configure-app) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20240923103033/https://help.branch.io/partners-portal/docs/segment-export)), the `$segment_anonymous_id` property contains the Segment Anonymous ID. According to [Segments's documentation](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/#identities-id) ([archived](https://archive.ph/mpuYk)), their IDs “[specify] a customer identity that you can reference across the customer’s whole lifetime”. The Anonymous ID is to be used in “cases where you don’t actually know who the user is according to your database, but you still want to be able to tie them to traits, events, or page views“.
