The `av` property in the query string always matches the app's version for the requests in our database. A few samples:

* [`av=7.0.1511`](https://data.tweasel.org/data/requests/do-they-track,24222) comes from `air.com.tutotoons.app.sweetbabygirlsummerfun2.free@7.0.1511`
* [`av=8.0.20007`](https://data.tweasel.org/data/requests/do-they-track,96599) comes from `com.tutotoons.app.jungleanimalhairsalon2.free@8.0.20007`
* [`av=1.8.6`](https://data.tweasel.org/data/requests/informed-consent,220540) comes from `anime.art.paint.tap.color.by.number.free@1.8.6`
* [`av=60.14.1`](https://data.tweasel.org/data/requests/ios-watching-you,37219) comes from `de.lotum.4pics1word@60.14.1`
* [`av=7.7.1`](https://data.tweasel.org/data/requests/worrying-confessions,30898) comes from `com.studysmarter@7.7.1`

It's also likely that "av" is an acronym for "app version".
